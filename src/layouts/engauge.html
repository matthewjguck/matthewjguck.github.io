      EnGauge was designed to be used by Voluntary Student Organizations (VSOs), dorms, and social groups on Stanford's campus. On a high level, EnGauge is a platform that allows groups to provide event details and timely reminders to group members, and gauge member interest via a 'Petition' feature for potential events. EnGauge was my final project for Stanford's CS 278 - Social Computing.
