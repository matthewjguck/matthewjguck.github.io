EnGauge was deisgned to be used by Voluntary Student Organizations (VSOs), dorms, and social groups on Stanford’s campus. On a high level, EnGauge is a platform that allows groups to: <br> <br>

• Provide event details and timely reminders to group members, <br>
• Gauge member interest via a “Petition” feature for potential events. <br> <br>

EnGauge was my final project for Stanford's CS 278 - Social Computing. View the final report below.
