    challenge: "Friends and family of diabetics often do not understand the basics of diabetes management."
    action: "I developed Diabetic Daycare, a Java-based educational Type 1 Diabetes simulator. The game utilizes a proprietary algorithmic model of insulin and blood glucose interactions to accurately simulate the experience of living with Type 1."
    future: "Moving forward with this project, I plan to reach out to pediatric endocrinology clinics with diabetes education training."

    curvetitle: "Dynamic Absorption Modeling: Insulin and Carbohydrate Interactions"
    curve: "This model leverages Gaussian distributions, or bell curves, to simulate the absorption rates of both insulin and carbohydrates. By applying this statistical approach, the model reflects the gradual onset, peak, and tapering of absorption, providing a more nuanced representation of real-world metabolic processes.  <br><br> 
    
        Carbohydrate absorption is variable, peaking between 30 to 120 minutes based on the glycemic index and complexity of the food. Simple carbohydrates are absorbed rapidly, while complex carbohydrates exhibit delayed peaks. Insulin absorption, by contrast, is more consistent, reaching its peak effectiveness at approximately 120 minutes post-injection.  <br><br>

        This approach enables a precise simulation of the interplay between insulin dosing and carbohydrate intake, offering a deeper understanding of blood glucose regulation in real-time.

        This version emphasizes the technical aspects while highlighting the insights gained from modeling these processes."
